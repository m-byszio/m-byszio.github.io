Welcome to the Random Realms Github page!

This website was created as the end project for the "Introduction to Digital Services" course during 
my Business Information Technology studies at Haaga-Helia.

Disclaimer: Code and Content were created in colaboration with ChatGPT. It was used as a tool to deepen my understanding
of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and to create certain content for the website itself. Namely the images and some of the generator outputs.
Any content was ultimately designed and curated by me.

How to use the generators

The intention behind the generators is to give you a place to start and feel inspired, 
to fill in just enough blank space, so whats there still tells you something about the gaps.
Especially the plot hook generator is not meant as a one click solution to creating a gripping plot but rather to practice your brain in combining aspects of a story,
that you might've not thought about otherwise.

This website might be expanded from this state in the future but will then be found in a separate repository to preserve the state at the time of submission to the teacher of the course.

Any inquires can be send to m.byszio+github@gmail.com
