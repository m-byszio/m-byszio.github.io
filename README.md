# Random Realms

Welcome to the **Random Realms** GitHub page!

This website was created as the **end project** for the *“Introduction to Digital Services”* course during my **Business Information Technology** studies at **Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences**.

## About This Project

“Random Realms” is a creative web project combining **fantasy-themed design** and **interactive generators** for NPCs and plot hooks — built to explore and apply modern **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** concepts.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – for the structure and content of the site  
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and responsive design   
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for the logic behind the NPC and Plot generators  
- **Figma** – for prototyping and layout planning  
- **Photopea / PowerPoint** – for image editing and transparency exports  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and project hosting

## Disclaimer: 
Code and content were created in collaboration with *ChatGPT*.  
It was used as a tool to **deepen my understanding** of front-end development and to assist with **image creation** and **content generation** for the site.  

All creative direction, design, and curation were done **personally by me**.

## How to Use the Generators

The generators are meant as **creative prompts**, not complete answers.

They are designed to:
- Spark inspiration for your own stories or characters.  
- Give you “just enough” to start imagining the spaces between the details.  
- Encourage you to combine ideas in unexpected ways.  

Especially the **Plot Hook Generator** is not a one-click story builder —  
it’s a **tool to exercise your imagination**, helping you connect threads you might not have considered otherwise.

## Future Development

This project represents the version submitted for the **course assignment**.  
Future expansions or redesigns will appear in a **separate repository**  
to preserve this version as it was at the time of submission.
